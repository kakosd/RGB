# RGB Color Picker 🎨

The inspiration for this project came from using the [RapidTables RGB Color Picker](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html) for web color design. Finding it inconvenient, I decided to create my own tool for a better and more efficient color-picking experience. This interactive RGB color picker is built with **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**, allowing users to select colors from a customizable palette, manually adjust RGB values, and copy HEX or RGB codes for use in design and development.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Color Picker** – Select any color using the SketchPicker component.
- **Preset Color Palette** – Choose from a curated grid of colors with smooth gradients.
- **HEX & RGB Display** – View and copy HEX and RGB color codes with one click.
- **Clipboard Copy** – Easily copy color values with a single button.
- **Responsive UI** – Works seamlessly across different screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js, React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Clipboard API**: JavaScript
- **Deployment**: Vercel
