RGB Color Picker 🎨

The inspiration for this project came from using the RapidTables RGB Color Picker for web color design. Finding it inconvenient, I decided to create my own tool for a better and more efficient color-picking experience. This interactive RGB color picker is built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, allowing users to select colors from a customizable palette, manually adjust RGB values, and copy HEX or RGB codes for use in design and development.

✨ Features

Interactive Color Picker – Select any color using the SketchPicker component.

Preset Color Palette – Choose from a curated grid of colors with smooth gradients.

HEX & RGB Display – View and copy HEX and RGB color codes with one click.

Clipboard Copy – Easily copy color values with a single button.

Responsive UI – Works seamlessly across different screen sizes.
